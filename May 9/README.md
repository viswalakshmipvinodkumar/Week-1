# OOP Concepts & Mini Projects (May 9, 2025)

This folder contains implementations of Object-Oriented Programming concepts and mini-projects that demonstrate various OOP principles including classes, objects, methods, attributes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

## Project Structure

### Core OOP Concept Implementations
- `simple_bank_account.py`: Interactive banking system with deposit, withdraw, and balance checking functionality
- `student_management_system.py`: A comprehensive student management system that allows adding, removing, and searching for students

### Data Analysis OOP Implementation
- `data_analysis_project.py`: Final project that integrates OOP concepts to load, process, and visualize sales data
- `data_validation_oop.py`: OOP implementation of data validation, statistics calculation, and output generation
- `sales_data.csv`: Sample sales data for the data analysis projects

### Output Files
- `output/`: Directory containing generated analysis reports, statistics, and visualizations
- `visualizations/`: Directory containing charts and graphs from the data analysis

## How to Run

### Simple Bank Account

```
python simple_bank_account.py
```

This interactive program demonstrates a bank account system with:
- Account creation with user input
- Deposit and withdrawal operations
- Balance checking functionality
- Menu-driven interface for user interaction

### Student Management System

```
python student_management_system.py
```

This comprehensive system demonstrates:
- Student record management (add, remove, search)
- Course enrollment management
- Student information updates
- Robust input validation
- Menu-driven interface for user interaction

### Data Analysis Project

```
python data_analysis_project.py
```

This final project integrates all the OOP concepts to:
1. Load data from a CSV file using the `DataLoader` class
2. Process data using the `DataProcessor` class
3. Create visualizations with the `DataVisualizer` class
4. Generate comprehensive reports using the `SalesAnalysisReport` class

### Data Validation OOP

```
python data_validation_oop.py
```

This advanced OOP implementation demonstrates:
1. Data loading and validation with the `DataLoader` class
2. Data quality assessment with the `DataValidator` class
3. Data processing and cleaning with the `DataProcessor` class
4. Statistical analysis with the `StatisticsCalculator` class
5. Output generation with the `OutputGenerator` class
6. Orchestration of the entire process with the `DataAnalysisApp` class

Note: You may need to install the required packages:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```
